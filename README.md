# Spot-a-mojo - What makes a song popular? (Team Scrapy)

## Core Objective & Hypothesis

We believe there are certain audio features that influence popularity of songs. It is our aim to discover what factors exemplify this.

## Primary Question

Does the correlation of certain qualities combined make a song popular and is it repeatable?
For example, if our team wanted to get together after this bootcamp and release an album, could we take these qualities and get a top 200 hit?
Were we able to answer the question?
Let’s visit this at the end when you’ve had a chance to see what we have to present!
