No thank you
Is what I should have said
I should be in bed
Temptations
Of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

One sip
Bad for me
One hit
Bad for me
One kiss
Bad for me
But I give in so easily

And no thank you
Is how it shoulda gone
I should stay strong

But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
(boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that)

No thank you
They call me after dark
I don't want no part
My habits
They hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

One sip
Bad for me
One hit
Bad for me
One kiss
Bad for me
But I give in so easily

And no thank you
Is how it shoulda gone
I should stay strong

But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that

We, we fall for that
Wake up
We fall again
(a a again fall fall fall)
We we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again
(boy oh boy ua boy oh boy fall again)

One sip
Bad for me
One hit
Bad for me
One kiss
Bad for me
But I give in so easily

And no thank you
Is how it shoulda gone
I should stay strong

But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
