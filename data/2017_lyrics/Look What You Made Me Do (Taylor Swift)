I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool
No, I don't like you

I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool
No, I don't like you
Ooh

But I got smarter
I got harder
In the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead
I do it all the time
I got a list of names
And yours is in red, underlined
I check it once
Then I check it twice
Ooh

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out
And threw a feast (What?)

The world moves on
Another day
Another drama drama
But not for me
Not for me
All I think about is karma
And then the world moves on
But one thing is for sure
Maybe I got mine
But you'll all get yours

But I got smarter
I got harder
In the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead
I do it all the time
I got a list of names
And yours is in red, underlined
I check it once
Then I check it twice
Ooh

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody
And nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress
Starring in your bad dreams

I don't trust nobody
And nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress
Starring in your bad dreams

I don't trust nobody
And nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress
Starring in your bad dreams

I don't trust nobody
And nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress
Starring in your bad dreams

"I'm sorry, the old Taylor
can't come to the phone right now
Why?
Oh, 'cause she's dead. "

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
