I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
Maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places
That tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitations

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places
That tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back


'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright
Know we would be alright
If you are by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright
Oh no we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright
I know we would be alright
If you are by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright
We would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby

Baby, there's nothing holding me back
