Are we too grown for games?
Are we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
Are we too grown for changin'?
Are we too grown to mess around?
Oh and I can't wait forever, baby
Both of us should know better

Been wishin' for you
Try to do what lovers do
Been wishin' for you
Try to do what lovers do
Been wishin' for you
Try to do what lovers do
Been wishin' for you
Try to do what lovers do
