You made plans and I
I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last
Good on paper
Picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence
But we paint it black

Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me
Harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me
But you always do

I've been hoping
Somebody loves you
In the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go

It's been some time
But this time ain't even
I can leave it in the past
But you're holding on to what you never had
Good on paper
Picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence
But we paint it black

Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me
Harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you would have waited for me
But you always do

I've been hoping
Somebody loves you
In the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
Someone will love you, let me go
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go (go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go

I've been hoping
Somebody loves you
In the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of
All of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
