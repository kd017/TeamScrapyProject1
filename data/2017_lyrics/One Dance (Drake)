[Intro: Kyla Wizkid]
Baby I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go Ot
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Hook: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers is taking a hold on me

[Bridge: Kyla Wizkid]
Baby I like your style

[Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Hook: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers is taking a hold on me

[Bridge: Kyla Wizkid]
Baby I like your style

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah

 [Bridge: Kyla Wizkid]
Baby I like your style
(I need a one dance, I,I,I a need a one dance) 

[Hook: Drake]
 I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers is taking a hold on me
