Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust them off 
 Put them back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field ?

Oo oo
I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling this since 1996 now
Might be over now, 
but I feel it still

Oo oo
I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might be over now, 
but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave her with a baby sitter,
Mamma, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Oo oo
I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still


Oo oo
I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like its 1986 now
Might be over now, 
but I feel it still

Oo oo
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel 
just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies
We could wave until 
the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel 
just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little tip
Kids in the middle move over til it falls
Won't bother me

(Is it coming)

Oo oo
I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, 
but I feel it still

Oo oo
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel 
just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, 
but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel 
just for kicks, now
Let me kick it 
like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, 
but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but I feel it still
