I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, 
honest (ooh-ooh)

Know you wonderin' why I've been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good

So I'm wondering, can we still be friends?
Can we still be friends?
Doesn't have to end
And if it ends, can we be friends?

Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?

Wondering if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left
Wondering if you think about me
Actually, don't answer that

Know you wonderin' why I've been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good


So I'm wondering, can we still be friends?
Can we still be friends?
Doesn't have to end
And if it ends, can we be friends?

Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
And if it ends, can we be friends?

Know you wonderin' why I've been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good

So I'm wondering, can we still be friends?
Can we still be friends?
Doesn't have to end
And if it ends, can we be friends?
