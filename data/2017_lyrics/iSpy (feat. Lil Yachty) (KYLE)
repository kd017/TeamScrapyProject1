Man fuck!
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids man, talking shit,
making me feel bad
Man fuck them kids bro
Look around bro, look at life
Man you're right
Hm, you see, you see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, whoa
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on man, you got so much more to appreciate man
Man you know what? Y-you're right
You damn right I'm right, 
I can't remember a time I 
was goddamn wrong
Man thanks Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

I ain't been gettin' high, well maybe a little
Baby I don't wanna lie

I know when you text me girl
I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, 
you can't even fly

I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's coming at me
I wonder who throws it

They can't see the vision
Boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie
I wonder who wrote it, oh shit

Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always tell the clowns around it
Look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either
These are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop
It's gonna be a motherfuckin' snow day

Ayy, boy is good and he knows it
He don't say it, he shows it
I am just like the Derozen
If I shoot it, it goes in

I'm in Cali just coastin'
Get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah
I just ain't never post it

And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags
And your house is no fun

You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get
'Cause don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie 
I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever
Ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get
'Cause don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie 
I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever
Ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I

She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs
Like balls in my nutsack
I remember riding around the city
In a Hatchback

Lookin' for a problem
With my young goblins
I'ma send a model home
With her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money
That it's non-stoppin'

Got my brothers on my back
Like the last name
I remember telling' everyone
I couldn't be tamed

Woah, six months later
I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains
To diamonds in another lane

Went from: Can you take me here?
To screening out the lane
Went from: Damn this nigga lame
To remember my name

So I remember all the people
Who ain't fucked with me
They went to college
Now all the niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to 
diamonds in my teeth

Riding deep in the van
Like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me, no
Lately I been livin' like luxury

Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get
'Cause don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie 
I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever
Ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get
'Cause don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever
Ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I
