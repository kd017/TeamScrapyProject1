Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a habibis ting, ya?

Yeah, my side girl got a 5s
With the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away
Better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody
Which is ironic 'cause your next album
Probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like
"how is niggas really gettin' down? "
I could never have a kid
Then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around
Where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150, 000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas
Just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up
Then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty
Man, I'm tryna make it now

[quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the benz just to the ride the wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt

Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (ugh)
Ike turner with the left hand (ike)
Griselda blanco with the trap moves
Gangland with the right hand
Undertaker with the tattoos
Never listen to the class rules
Switch it up, they bit the last move
(let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches
You got the goin' out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain (racks)
You spent your last fifty (ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets
You got the key to defeat
I got the keys to the warzone (brrapt!)
You got the key to the peace (ugh)

Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the benz just to ride the wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[travis scott]
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose, off the henny
'roc, and a hint of goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' dead prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my rollie, told my bitch
"let's go snorkelin'! "
Out in portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with jay
But I still send a tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and drake kick like kid n' play
The way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free max b out the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

[quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the benz just to the ride the wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt, oh
