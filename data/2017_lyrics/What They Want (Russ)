They let us in the rap game
I swear they let me in
the motherfucking rap game

Got a chick, I call her Lola
She feel like the ocean
Like to drink and smoke some doja
And I feel like smokin'
Plus she good at charmin' cobras
I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia
She be actin bougie
Then she came through and topped me off
Now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the Mafia
Her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones, no no

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't foolin' me at all

I been at this shit for 9 years
now they startin' to call
I'm a Diy pioneer
they tryna get involved
Yippee kiyay, aw yeah, 'bout to set it off
I'm probably the only one, yeah
Come correct when you approach me
I can size you up
Takin' all the shots like Kobe
almost 81
Guess I gotta play the goalie and go and save me some
I'm probably the only one, ye-ah

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't foolin' me at all

Who wants my money
I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Who's pullin' strings
I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck
they be talkin' like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me
Dollars, lotta stock in me
It ain't nothin' personal
it's business and I'm a commodity
But honestly, Pop Pop would be turnin' in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss in me
I'll be damned

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't foolin' me at all
