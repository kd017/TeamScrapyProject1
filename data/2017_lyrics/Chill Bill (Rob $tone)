Rob $tone, two damn phones
Babylons can't crack the code
Used to sip out Styrofoam 
But figured I should stick to dro (weed)
Backwoods overload, don't like to smoke them swishers hoe
If you hit my liquor store 
It fifty cents for single puffs

Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said "baby, just buy that shit
'Cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud, but no money, babe, buy me a Fiji"
She said "you need a job", bitch, fuck a job I still get trees

Two cell phones, Mr. Motha fuck a thot
Mr. I be on that block
Twelve o seven fuck a op
They hear my name, they see my squad
Rolling dope up on the spot
I'm with your bitch, she on my jock
Ain't got no time to love a thot

Got niggas mad my flow so hot
Got niggas mad my squad won't stop
We in the game won't take no loss
I'm sippin water out the Voss
Got lean all in my fuckin' Sprite
Turnin' up on fuckin' sight
Mr. Kenny Powers 'bout to
Take your girlfriend home tonight, bitch

And I'm smokin' on the widow when you see it out the window
Got a dusty old tee, look up on me leave it simple
Growin' up I was always in the middle 
So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little
And my brothas beside me, so fuck it, we mobbing, please
Don't be scrammin' on finding me but I be an OG
If a 'lil fuck boy lame ass wanna creep
I live by the limit 'cause a fucka chose me

Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said "baby, just buy that shit
'Cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud, but no money, babe, buy me a Fiji"
She said "you need a job", bitch, fuck a job I still get trees (trees, trees)
