And she said
You a god damn lie
I ain't mean to say
That shit girl I was god damn high
So we left the crib now
We in the god damn ride
She lookin' god damn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to earth
But she want the god damn skies
List of my problems
Got this one on my line
That won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out
I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that
Tell her you love her
When next week you just want your space
Why you do why you do that
Tell her you want her
But next week you do your own thing
Why you do why you do that
I can't explain it
But just know it working for me
She text me I hate you I hate you
I hate you I hate you
But how the fuck can you hate me
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thing
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I never been the one, to try to explain
While you catch them feels
Imma sip on this drank
It's easing my brain

I got real shit to stress about girl
I ain't worried bout shit
Remember that I tried to build ya
Now I ain't worried bout shit
I got real shit to stress about girl
I ain't worried bout shit
Remember that I tried to build ya
Now I ain't worried bout shit
So I found me a new thing
I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown
All they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thing
I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown
All they need is drank and that dank

Now I'm like
It's a god damn shame
We done crashed we done burned
But baby you the god damn blame
See I wanted love but you wanted
God damn fame
Every god damn thing
I wanted a bitch who was on the move
But you want to god damn lay
List of my problems
Got this one in my bed
And she just wants to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets
She only wake up to eat
Do this shit every week
Like why you do that
Crying you want to be great
But sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that
Don't got that much in the bank
We go out she order the steak
Why you do why you do that
She can't explain it
But just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck
But really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit, but be the real thing
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I won't be the one, to try to explain
While you catch them feels
Imma sip on this drank
It's easing the pain

I got real shit to stress about girl
I ain't worried bout shit
Remember that I tried to build ya
Now I ain't worried bout shit
I got real shit to stress about girl
I ain't worried bout shit
Remember that I tried to build ya now
I ain't worried bout shit
So I found me a new thing
I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown
All they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thing
I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown
All they need is drank and that dank
