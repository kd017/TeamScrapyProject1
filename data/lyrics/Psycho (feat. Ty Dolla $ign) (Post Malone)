Yeah, my Ap goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds
by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My Ap goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds
by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend
when I'm rollin' through my end zone

You stuck in the friend zone
I tell her four, five, the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, Dechino the s**t, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "S**t, this is it, " ayy
Thirty-four walk through, man we had every slit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benz
where we get seen in a rent
And I'm like whoa versuri-lyrics. info
Man, my dash so goddamn cold
Diamonds wear my t-shirt solo
I got homies, let it ball, oh, oh
My money, they won't ever fall
She said "Can I have some to hold? "
And I can never tell you no

Yeah, my Ap goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show
got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My Ap goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show
got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend
when I'm rollin' through my end zone

The Ap goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
We're hittin' lil mamas, she wanna have my babies
Sippy on the panky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' b***h
Now we ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Coolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one swish, I can make the eyes drop
Take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, we gon' hit Rodeo
Y'all a Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the stones
They said I been overnight
now these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jean, still don't let my fans though
All Vvss, put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the boul
They matching with the jewelry

Yeah, my Ap goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show
got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My Ap goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
