Trap, trap money benny
This shit got me in my feeling

Are you riding, say you'll never ever leave
From beside me, cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Kb, do you love me
Are you riding say you'll never ever leave
From beside me, cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I down for you always

Look the real me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me
Before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices
They running out of options
Cause I've been going off
And they don't know when its stopping
And we came to the top
And I see that you've been learning
And when I take you shopping
You spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex
He deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump
That confirmed it
