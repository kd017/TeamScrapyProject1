Well, you hold the line
When every one of them is giving up or giving in, tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache, cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

And you're standing on the edge face up
Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Will somebody let me see the light
within the dark trees' shadows
And what's happening
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong
within the past knowin'
We are the youth
Call out to the beast, not a word without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache, cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

And you're standing on the edge face up
Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world

Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Deep inside me
I'm fading to black
I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood on my hand
won't break it

I can taste it
The end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Natural
Yeah, you're a natural
