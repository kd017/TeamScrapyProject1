If the devil wrote a Bible
Here's what he would say
Live your life just as you please
Do things your own way
As long as you don't hurt nobody
You're free to play the game
You can keep on winning
If you play my way
Black is white, wrong's alright
You can do anything you like
If you win the game
Black is white, wrong's alright
You can do anything you like
Don't let nothin' stand in your way
If you listen to his message
His words get in your heart
And takes hold like cancer
Till your life just comes apart
You're only gonna go 'round one time
You better make it pay
It takes a special courage
To refuse to say
Black is white, wrong's alright
You can do anything you like
If you win the game
Black is white, wrong's alright
You can do anything you like
Don't let nothin' stand in your way
