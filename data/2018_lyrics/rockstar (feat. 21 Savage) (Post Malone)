Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, name them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire 
Like I'm Morrison (ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show 
In a cop car (ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a Tv out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin'
Don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie
She just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket
Tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer
Say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (yeah, ayy, ayy)

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, name them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow)

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (no bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "no m√°s" (yeah, yeah)
They like "Savage, why you got a twelve
Car garage and you only got six cars?"(21)
I ain't with the cakin'
How you kiss that? (kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' 
Like a whole snack (big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe
 I got old racks (old racks)
L. A. bitches always askin'
"Where the coke at? " (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar
Smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart
You know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart
 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar
 I'm livin' like a rockstar (ayy)

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (yeah)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, name them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta 

Star, star, rockstar, rockstar, star
Rockstar

Rockstar
