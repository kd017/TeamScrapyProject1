Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
We'll comfort you for sure

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are, I'll run to your front door
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I will run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Loves, between our love
Loves, between our love

Shadows play on idle hands
I'll lose myself if I do
But I've found my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where were we are
you're still the one I choose
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hun' where were you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I will run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave (in a wave)
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Loves, between our love
Loves, between our love

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I will run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
