Oh, yeah, alright
Ooh (yeah)

Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still I don't go there

Everybody says "say something"
Say something, say something
Then say something, say something, then say something

I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)

I hear them call my name
Everybody says "say something"
Then say something, say something
Then say something, say something then say something

I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)

Sometimes the greatest the way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest the way to say something is to say nothing

But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have (maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)
