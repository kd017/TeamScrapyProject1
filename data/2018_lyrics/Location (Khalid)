Send me your location let's
Focus on communicating 'cause
I just need the time
And place to come through
(a chance to come through)
Send me your location let's
Ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

At times I wonder why 
I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna 
fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, 
so don't
Take advantage
Don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go
A little bit better when you plan it

So won't you send me, 
your location let's
Focus on communicating 'cause
I just need the time
And place to come through
Send me your location let's
Ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets so
Let's keep personal
I got a lot of cool spots 
that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 
'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
I might make you mine by the night

Send me your location let's
Focus on communicating 'cause
I just need the time and 
place to come through
(a chance to come through)
Send me your location let's
Ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

Ride, ride, ride, come and 
vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and 
vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you
