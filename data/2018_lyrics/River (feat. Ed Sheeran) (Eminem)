I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched
To catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breast jacket's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back
Like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick
And she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said "Bye Susan"
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand
Turned in two-night stand
He was calling so might scram
Now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt
But what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you
Like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit... fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
Denver (ooh), watch the river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey! "
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe
That's why I made they came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
Well, I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle, left us in a wreck-tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie
To tell a unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one (I'm sorry), I don't wanna admit to something
(I fucked up) If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run
