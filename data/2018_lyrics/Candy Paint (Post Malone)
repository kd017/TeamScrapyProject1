Yeah, yeah
MM, ayy

Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (skrrt)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (drop)
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot (pop)
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (bling)
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot (swish)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (yuh)
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn, I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (yeah)
I can do things that your man cannot (yeah)
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (hot)
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (locked)
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas'
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for
But you don't fuckin' know me
Homie, you don't want war (ayy)

Hit the switch up the suicide doors (damn)
We already know you vanished though (ooh)
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these muhfuckas' so false with me (yah)
If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (no)
Take a second if you think about crossin' me

It lasts forever, you should try a sample (goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for (what I stand for)
But you don't fuckin' know me
Homie, you don't want war (you don't want war)
