Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit)
Whatever I'm downin' got me goin' crazy (yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (alright)

I always try to zero out on the lean (yeah, yeah)
Then this girl came in and saved my life
Look up to the sky, down on my knees (straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the night-time (woo, yah)

Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (roll)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (oh no)

Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit)
Whatever I'm downin' got me goin' crazy (yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (alright)
I always try to zero out on the lean (yeah, yeah)
Then this girl came in and saved my life
Look up to the sky, not at my lean (straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to stay the night
In the night-time (woo, yah)
