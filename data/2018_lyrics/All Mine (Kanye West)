Yeah, you supermodel thick, damn
That ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle

Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go and back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
Juicy thing, make that pussy say
"one more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come, go hold this shit"

Yeah, you supermodel thick, damn
That ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle

If I pull up with a kerry washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have naomi campbell
And still might want me a stormy daniels
Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' corey gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy your sample
All these thots on christian mingle
Almost what got tristan single
If you don't ball like him or kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable and I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic, that's just some ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome with you and the blunt
I love your titties, 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

Yeah, you supermodel thick, damn
That ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

Let me hit it raw, like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some dri-fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

Yeah, you supermodel thick, damn
That ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle
