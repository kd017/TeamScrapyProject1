Alright, I'm ready now
I ain't gonna fall back down now
Alright, I'll take it on me
All I ever ask is
Are you gonna be my lover tonight?
And take it with me

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind

Alright, I'm ready now
I ain't gonna stop right now, no
Alright, I'll take it on me
All I ever ask is
Do you wanna see my fire tonight?
And take it with me

What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, nevermind, nevermind
