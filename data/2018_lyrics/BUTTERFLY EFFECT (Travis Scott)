Murda on the beat so it's not nice

For this life, I cannot change
Hidden hills, deep off in the main
M&m's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
(pop it, pop it)
For this life, I cannot change
Hidden hills, deep off in the main
M&m's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
(pop it, pop it)

Drop the top, play hide and seek
Jump inside, jump straight to the league
Take a sip, feel just how I breathe
On freeway, but no, ain't nothin' free
(straight up)
Bend laws, bend lanes
Been bustin' bills
But still ain't nothin' change
You in the mob soon as you rock the chain
She caught the waves
Just thumbin' through my braids (alright)
Heatin' up, baby, I'm just heatin' up (it's lit)
Need ya love, not a need it is a must
Feelin' stuck, you know how to keep me up
Icy love, icy like a hockey puck

For this life, I cannot change
Hidden hills, deep off in the main
M&m's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
(pop it, pop it)
For this life, I cannot change
Hidden hills, deep off in the main
M&m's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang

All the ones
All the chains piled on the mantle
All the dogs
All the dogs low creep
Right behind me in the phantom
Never go, never go dip on the set
Stayed santana
Yeah, run it back
Turn the lights on when I hit up green lantern
Yeah, fly the broads
Fly the dogs down to atlanta
Yeah, in the cut in medusa
Lay low, yeah, I might be
Yeah, roll up, help me calm down
When I'm movin' high speed
Yeah, if I send one
Need the text back 'cause you know what I need
Oh, please (oh please)
Oh me (oh me)
Oh my (oh my)
We been movin'
We been movin' for some time (alright!)
Flexin', flexin' try to exercise
Exercise, exercise, exercise, exercise

For this life, I cannot change
Hidden hills, deep off in the main
M&m's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
(pop it, pop it)
For this life, I cannot change
Hidden hills, deep off in the main
M&m's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
(yah!)
