Look
I just flipped the switch (flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doing this
Bodies start to drop (hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ay
This a rollie not a stopwatch
Shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot
Shit got super hot
Give me my respect, give me my respect
I just took it left like I'm ambidextrous
Bitch I move through london with the eurostep
Gotta sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me cause I'm going (outta there I'm gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm lebron?
Servin' up a pack, serving' up a pack
Niggas pulling' gimmicks
Cause they scared to rap
Funny how they shuck, ay got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself take a look
I'm a bar spitta, I'm hard hitta
Yeah I'm light skinned
But I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a weak splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgiving wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin wrong with em, got em' all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a grave digger
Yeah I am what I am
I don't have no time
For no misunderstandings again
This a rollie not a stopwatch
Shit don't ever stop
Future took the business and ran it for me
I let ollie take the owl told him
Brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop
And that's standard for me
Like I went blind dog you gotta hand it to me
Prayed, then I prayed again
Had a moment but it came and went
You don't wanna play with him
They'll be mourning you like 8am
Pinky ring till I get a wedding ring
Love my brothers cut em in on anything
And you know it's king slime drizzy man

Either hand is the upper hand
Got a? on my other hand
This shit a hundred bands
Palace look like buckingham
Bills so big I call em williams
Shit go crazy got trill ya for real
They been trying me
But I'm resilient for real
I can't go in public like civilian for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge man that's hardly an expense
I'm claiming checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit man I hardly do percents
A big part of me resent niggas
That I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got
And man it's hard to be content
Fuck they got what they got going on
I gotta represent
This a rollie not a stopwatch
Shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot
Shit got super hot
