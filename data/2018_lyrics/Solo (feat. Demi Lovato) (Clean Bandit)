It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
Woop woop woop woop woop woop woop

I never meant to leave you hurting
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (it solo, solo, everybody)
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (it solo, solo, everybody)

Since you've been gone
Been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more

I wanna f-woop woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry but I like to party
T-t-touch but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo

Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music without you
(it solo, solo, everybody)
Ah, yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from calling
But I really wanna know if you're with someone new
(it solo, solo, everybody)

Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more

I wanna f-woop woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry but I like to party
T-t-touch but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo

Can't do it solo

I wanna f-woop woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry but I like to party
T-t-touch but I got nobody
Here on my own (here on my own)
I wanna f-woop woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo (it solo, solo, everybody)
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I do it solo

So I do it solo
