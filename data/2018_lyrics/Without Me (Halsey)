Without me, without me, yeah
Without me, without me, yeah

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

I say I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you can take advantage of me

Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made them mine
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Say I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you can take advantage of me

Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why
Thinking you could live without me
And live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did
I'm over know
But how'd you gonna find out for them?
So tell me how's it feel

Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why)
